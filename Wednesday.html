                        	<h2 id="toc_0">Introduction</h2>

<p>According to Henriques (2014), almost every college counseling center director reported that the number of students who have been diagnosed with mental illness is on the rise. This serious phenomenon has raised people&#39;s increasing awareness of students&#39; mental health. Mental health is of crucial importance to a college student since college is the place where significant impacts on individuals take place. However, even if an undergraduate is in a terrible mental condition, little care is given to improve mental health, the result of which is undoubtedly slumps in academic performance (Gorczynski, 2018). Thereby, in order to have ideal grades and enjoyable life in universities, an undergraduate should give top priority to their mental health in universities (Wakeford, 2017). In this case, the most optimal mental state is positive attitude and peace of mind, which refers to a healthy mental state in which one is optimistic and willing to act towards solving problems without anxiety or negativity. In his article, Wakeford(2017) has identified academic stress, isolation, balancing work and study, financial difficulties and living independently as the main aspects of mental health. Nonetheless, things might be slightly different among NUS undergraduates. Aiming to find out the mental health conditions of NUS undergraduates, we had decided to investigate them through surveys. Through investigating about the factors causing happiness or stress and how our respondents cope with difficult situations in daily life, our group have got to know more about the general mental states of NUS undergraduates and some minor difference between students with different gender, faculty or grade.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Methodology</h2>

<p>We had investigated 180 undergraduates in Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences(FASS), Faculty of Engineering(ENG), Faculty of Science(FoS), School of Design and Environment(SDE), School of Computing(SoC) and School of Business(BIZ). The researchers had been divided into 6 groups. Each group is responsible for surveying 30 students of one faculty through face-to-face interview or distributing questionnaires. The questions mainly focus on the origin of stress and happiness and the undergraduates&#39; attitudes towards daily life.</p>

Two articles from The Economist and Alex Renton discuss about the origins and effects of ocean acidification. Since factories produced massive carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, oceans will irrevocably absorb them with results including both positive and negative influence on the world as a whole.</p>

<h4 id="toc_2">Studying with a positive attitude</h4>

<p>{Origin}: &quot;Enjoy&quot; life<br/>
{Significance}: Education can shape one in a either positive or negative way depends on pupils themselves.<br/>
URL:<a href="https://nation.com.pk/01-Jan-2016/studying-with-a-positive-attitude?show=previewutm_medium=Politic">https://nation.com.pk/01-Jan-2016/studying-with-a-positive-attitude?show=previewutm_medium=Politic</a></p>

<p>In these days studying is considered as a trouble by majority of young students, as they only want to enjoy their lives and consider study to be unimportant. Our younger generation has taken everything for granted and do not hold high value for education in their minds.<br/>
Whenever the time comes to study, a student’s mood sinks down and all the energy vanishes. This results in more time being consumed in learning that work due to lesser concentration. This issue needs to be addressed by parents and teachers in a productive manner, not simply forcing their children to more hours of studying or getting tuition after schools.<br/>
There should be some counseling in a way that explains to children that studying is one of the natural things to do in this world, as education makes a man, so can the lack of education break a man. They should be told that if studying is compulsory and necessary then why not do it with an enthusiasm similar to playing sports or performing some other activities and hobbies.</p>

<h4 id="toc_3">Positive Attitude, Positive Mind</h4>

<p>URL: <a href="https://www.wholebeing-wellbeing.com/positive-attitude-positive-mind/">https://www.wholebeing-wellbeing.com/positive-attitude-positive-mind/</a></p>

<p>{Origin of negativeness}: Pressure<br/>
{Symptoms of negativeness__}: Depressed<br/>
{Solutions}: Work out or simply go out, meditation or other means of relax and re-prioritize tasks</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Re-evaluate priorities – what is important right now and what can be delayed?<br/>
Go for a walk – even some exercise is better than none and it gives you a chance to think, contemplate, or just be.<br/>
Daily quiet time – take ten to twenty minutes to unwind, relax, meditate or have a bath, with no interruptions from the phone, TV, kids or family.<br/>
Have fun – make sure to incorporate some fun time into your life – go out with friends, catch a movie, play sport or do a hobby.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>{Effects}: Better Marriage, income, relationship and physical body.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Marital/relationship satisfaction<br/>
Higher incomes<br/>
Friendship/social development, and<br/>
Better physical health.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="toc_4">Positive Attitude Leads to Positive Thinking and Positive Calm.</h4>

<p>URL: <a href="http://www.positivecalm.com/positive-thinking-attitude/">http://www.positivecalm.com/positive-thinking-attitude/</a></p>

<p>{Origin}: lack of motivation of action</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The average person will not make any effort to do the change required in order to change their &#39;sad&#39; circumstances, and so they better complain and moan about all the unjust in the world and how they are the victims of everything that happens to them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>{Solution}: Think about what you want to appreciate for</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every morning when you wake up think of 5 reasons to be grateful for… Why in the morning?The morning is the most difficult time to get you into a mood of thinking positive, it will uplift your mood immediately and you will start a day with a positive state of mind. <br/>
Same for the night</p>
</blockquote>

<p>{Effects}: Positive attitude will make you take actions and do something, which will improve your life.</p>

<p>{Solution}:</p>

<ol>
<li>Monitor your thoughts. Mind is like a garden where thoughts can be beautiful flowers or garden weeds. Thoughts are energy, the energy tends to transform in material things. Use this to your advantage – encourage positive thinking. Slowly begin to substitute negative thoughts with more optimistic ones. Stop worrying. We have 30,000-75,000 thoughts per day, most of them are nonproductive, worrying thoughts. If the thoughts don’t improve our state of mind, get rid of them.</li>
<li>Be mindful. Live in the moment. Pay attention and enjoy the experiences you have right this moment.</li>
<li>Always strive to be a good person, do the right thing. Be helpful.</li>
<li>Have a sense of humor. Laughter is a great stress reducer. Be playful, don’t take yourself too seriously.</li>
<li>Take care of your health: eat right, exercise.</li>
<li>Slow down. Take time to plan your actions. Stop making decisions on autopilot. Take all the decision that you make automatically and reevaluate your actions, there may be a better solution.</li>
<li>Connect with others.</li>
<li>Be thankful for the good things in your life.</li>
<li>Have goals; know where you are headed.</li>
<li>Evaluate once a year your positions. Are you happy with your job? Are you happy with your relationships? Make adjustments- fix it or let it go.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="toc_6">Positive Attitude Is a State of Mind You Can Adopt</h4>

<p>URL: <a href="https://www.successconsciousness.com/positive_attitude_thinking.htm">https://www.successconsciousness.com/positive_attitude_thinking.htm</a></p>

<p>{Symptom of positiveness}:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People with a positive frame of mind think about possibilities, growth, expansion and success. They expect happiness, health, love and good relationships. They think in terms of,<br/>
&#39;I can&#39;<br/>
&#39;I am able&#39;<br/>
&#39;I will succeed&#39;.<br/>
People with a positive attitude are not daunted by failures and obstacles. If things don&#39;t turn out well or as expected, they will try again. They approach what they do with a positive thinking frame of mind.</p>

<li>Read inspiring and motivating stories about people who achieved success. This will inspire and motivate you, as well as show you what they actually did, so you can implement it in your life.</li>
<li>Use affirmations. These positive statements will sink into your subconscious mind, which in turn will guide, motivate, and inspire you to tale action.</li>
<li>This also applies to visualization, the creation of mental scenes of what you want to achieve or have.</li>
<li>You don&#39;t have to allow negative thoughts to thrive in your mind. You can put an end to this habit. Be on guard to replace you negative thoughts with constructive ones. Start paying attention to your thoughts, and as negative thoughts start circulating in your mind, calmly, and without using force, replace them with constructive, happy and positive thoughts. You can make great changes in your life if you play the role of the doorkeeper of your mind.</li>
<li>Take action, don&#39;t be passive, in small matters and in big ones. If you keep busy doing things, there will be less likelihood of becoming negative, and a greater likelihood of being positive.</li>

With a positive mindset, you always expect more joy, happiness, better health, greater success which also helps you reduce your stress levels. Basically, whatever your mind thinks and believes is what you expect. Anticipate positive situations and you&#39;ll get positive outcomes.

<p>Lack of sleep can have various severe damage to human&#39;s body. Firstly, sleep deficiency can give rise to chaos of chemical distribution and further more to unstable mood. Secondly, short of sleep is part of reasons of workers&#39; inattention which is the main cause of some tragic cases. Similarly, drivers are less likely to focus without sufficient sleep. Lastly, sleep absence caused by fanaticism or overloaded work may result in profound harm on health. Therefore excessive work and school plan should really be altered to ensure basic sleep requirement.</p>

<p>Genetically modified food refer to the food whose genes have been changed by the scientists. When it comes to food with altered genes, people often have diverse opinions considering its effects. Firstly, transgenic food must has benefits since scientists develop them with positive intention. Those food can collect superior genes together to prevent themselves from being devastated by pests or herbicides (Food, Genetically Modified, 2014). The added genes can also stimulate the plants to have more nutrition, the result of which is better flavor and quality(Bosch, n.d). Moreover, it can help reserving the limited resource on earth such as water and energy(Bosch, n.d). Nevertheless, such highly controversial products indeed have some demerits. A plausible inference is variations caused by genes transformation might occur. Thus, concerned common sense no longer makes sense facing those food, especially to individuals who are allergic to certain type of food (Schneider and Schneider, 2009). Integration of two disparate comestible potentially results in severe consequences without mention of new constituent. More seriously, food engineers themselves might unconsciously compose some toxic chemicals during the process which certainly does massive harm to citizens&#39; health (Vrain, 2013). In conclusion, while Genetically modified foods provide humans with foods with better resilience to possible damage and greater quality, they also give rise to worry about potential toxin and allergy it brings because of reform of genes and protein sequences. </p>
