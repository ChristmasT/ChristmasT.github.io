<p><strong>Synthesis:</strong></p>

<p>A rainforest is a forest located in the tropical part of the earth which consists of numerous densely arranged tall trees. Recent years have witnessed the recession of rainforest: from 30% of the earth in 1950 to 6% in 2002 due to humans&#39; exploitation in resources. Four reasons can be found to justify the significance of preserving rainforest.</p>

<ol>
<li>Firstly, rainforest offer natural livelihood for tropical citizens with not only food but also material wealth and even sacred belief. Thus once rainforest is spoiled, those civilizations will no longer exist.</li>
<li>Secondly, rainforest hides great amount of medicinal value. A prominent example is that there are over 2000 tropical rainforest plants can be used to deter cancer. Also rainforest plants contribute to about 40% prescribed drugs in US.</li>
<li>Thirdly, rainforest are crucial on keeping the water and soil resource, without which natural catastrophe will happen.</li>
<li>last but not least, as it is known to all, rainforest is the lung of the earth. Through absorbing of CO2 and emission of O2, rainforest can remarkably improve the air quality as well as restrain the climate change.<br/>
Therefore, rainforest plays an indispensable role in humans&#39; ecosystem which explains why it must be preserved.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="toc_1">Exercise 4: Synthesis - Globalisation</h2>

<p><strong>Synthesis</strong><br/>
Globalization is defined as a trend to unify the world in aspects like economy, culture and technology which started as early as European colonial era (Ellwood, 2001) which has been boosted up in recent years by moldering development of technology, sophisticated transportation and unrestricted flow of money. (Longman Dictionary, 2000)</p>

<p>These are few prominent merits of globalization. The most evident one is that it provides the world with easier and wider contact including communication in both prevailing culture and distinct commodities. Barbie dolls, fast food and hip-pop can find their place to survive. So can characteristic specialty like Thai, Szechuan and Indian food (Ransome, 1997)</p>

<p>Nonetheless, some severe impacts had been brought to the world by globalization. Firstly, it gave rise to the increasingly broadened wealth gap. Authority of determination had been aggregated in the hands of minority. Secondly, ethnic culture had been ravaged by the invasion of foreign culture. Moreover, globalization is also the criminal of devastating of environment, regional conflicts and deficiency of sense of collectivity.</p>

<p>At present, governments are losing dominance on globalization and therefore need to regulate systems and future arrangement to coordinate with drastic transformation brought by globalization. Only taking care of occupation humanâ€™s basic need and economy as well as preservation of ecosystems can government ensure globalization is on the right track.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Paragraph:</h3>

<p>Film editor <u>is</u>  a person who can proficiently cut a film or short movie with professional applications and make profit from it. Nowadays, it <u>is</u> significantly important for unprofessional individuals to condense their special memory into a short trailer. Therefore there <u>is</u> no surprise to find out that film editors can gain great amount of money within short amount of time. However, the images for film editors <u>are</u> usually some overweighted persons with red and sleepy eyes. As a matter of fact, that <u>is</u> not always the case. Since these people are willing to devote their time for editing film, they must find editing interesting and worthwhile. Furthermore, they can also maintain a good shape through working out regularly in the interval of two orders. Hence being a film editor may <u>be</u> one of my favorite occupations in the future.</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">Comparison targets:</h3>

<p>Taking note with electronic devices and traditionally taking note with pen and book.</p>

<h3 id="toc_5">Paragraph:</h3>

<p>Today is 2018 when everything is trending in becoming digital. Thus, it is extremely difficult for college students to choose if they should take notes with their tablets and laptops. Note-taking on electronic devices has way more convenience in transferring data through cloud service. Also it <u>has</u> a prominent advantage that traditional books don&#39;t <u>have</u> which is the weight students take to class are significantly lighter. Nevertheless, that doesn&#39;t mean the traditional way is an outdated way. Countless researches internationally <u>have</u> shown that handwriting <u>has</u> more assistance in helping students to memorize knowledge. What&#39;s more is that with a  mere set of pen and notebook, listeners are less likely to be distracted by the messages popping up. Therefore in conclusion, these two ways of taking note both have their pros and cons, what undergraduates should do is wisely choose the tools in different circumstances. After all, the method is not the thing that matters, the knowledge is.</p>

<p>Hello everyone, This is Mike.</p>

<p>Today, our main focus is this picture. </p>

<h2 id="toc_0">I see</h2>

<p>A pretty horrible picture, isn&#39;t it? Then what do you see on the picture?</p>

<ol>
<li>I see the whole picture is set in the tone of dark red </li>
<li>I see a river in the middle of the image.</li>
<li>I see lots of shabby houses built along the river.</li>
<li>I see a woman crouching near the river with a bowl.</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="toc_1">I think</h2>

<hr/>

<p>Right now, I believe you already have lots of profound thoughts about this photo. Here are some of mine.</p>

<ol>
<li>I think the dark red color precisely conveys how poor and terrible the environment is.</li>
<li>I think the river might be the only water source for the citizens here.</li>
<li>I think people there are still live in a fairly primitive way due to lack of development and poor infrastructures.</li>
<li>I think the woman was washing her clothes in the muddy river or to make the matter worse, she was probably washing the food prepared for the whole family.</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="toc_2">I wonder</h2>

<p>Having looked at the photo, there is indeed something that we should consider about. </p>

<ol>
<li>I wonder how long will they live under such unbearable circumstances. </li>
<li>I wonder how Singapore strived to be a powerful country from this situation.</li>
<li>I wonder how many people today are still suffering from similar perishing sanitation systems.</li>
</ol>

<p>So just look around, to appreciate how wonderful your living conditions are compared to theirs. You have clean water to wash your face and clothes; You have favorite phones and laptops; You can sit in such comfortable class and meanwhile have the leisure to listen to my speech. How lucky we are! So please, widely open your eyes, you might discover that the people and things beside you are actually the most precious fortune that you&#39;ve ever had.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
