		<h2 id="toc_0">Section A:</h2>

<p>Lack of sleep can have various severe damage to human&#39;s body. Firstly, sleep deficiency can give rise to chaos of chemical distribution and further more to unstable mood. Secondly, short of sleep is part of reasons of workers&#39; inattention which is the main cause of some tragic cases. Similarly, drivers are less likely to focus without sufficient sleep. Lastly, sleep absence caused by fanaticism or overloaded work may result in profound harm on health. Therefore excessive work and school plan should really be altered to ensure basic sleep requirement.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Section B:</h2>

<p>Genetically modified food refer to the food whose genes have been changed by the scientists. When it comes to food with altered genes, people often have diverse opinions considering its effects. Firstly, transgenic food must has benefits since scientists develop them with positive intention. Those food can collect superior genes together to prevent themselves from being devastated by pests or herbicides (Food, Genetically Modified, 2014). The added genes can also stimulate the plants to have more nutrition, the result of which is better flavor and quality(Bosch, n.d). Moreover, it can help reserving the limited resource on earth such as water and energy(Bosch, n.d). Nevertheless, such highly controversial products indeed have some demerits. A plausible inference is variations caused by genes transformation might occur. Thus, concerned common sense no longer makes sense facing those food, especially to individuals who are allergic to certain type of food (Schneider and Schneider, 2009). Integration of two disparate comestible potentially results in severe consequences without mention of new constituent. More seriously, food engineers themselves might unconsciously compose some toxic chemicals during the process which certainly does massive harm to citizens&#39; health (Vrain, 2013). In conclusion, while Genetically modified foods provide humans with foods with better resilience to possible damage and greater quality, they also give rise to worry about potential toxin and allergy it brings because of reform of genes and protein sequences. </p>
