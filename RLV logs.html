As an incentive for human determination, convenience offers people with more efficient and relaxed method of coping tasks. Bearing &quot;saving-the-efforts&quot; in mind, humans are unconsciously driven by convenience. The revolution of convenience can be traced back in the 20th century when machine helped a lot in saving labor force. However some people resisted it because of the need of self-expression and thereby continued growing their vegetables. Then the second revolution which saw the potential of customization came. Numerous services for individualization came to the market, making self-expression inevitably homogeneous. Struggles may seem trivial in the era of convenience, but they provide individuals with the answer of who they are. In conclusion, while enjoying the convenience multiple tools bring about, one shall never forget the joy of doing something slowly yet happily in those &quot;inconvenient&quot; ways.</p>

<h2 id="toc_5">Review and thinking:</h2>

<p>China nowadays has increasingly significant status in the international network system. The most apparent reason is China is a country with 1.4 billion citizens. Therefore, even a tiny origin can stir a mass disturbance on the Internet which can be either positive or negative. Thus countless opportunities can be found in the phase when China is developing. However, instead of merely emphasize on how enormous Chinese Internet marketplace is. The speech stressed more on the facility the Internet can offer to those impecunious families with more alternatives. The Internet is offering billions of people with plentiful work positions as well as more advanced education within the speed of life. For those who came from metropolises, accessing to the Internet may be a rather easy task. Nevertheless, their ease may never be reachable for unprivileged individuals, speaking of which Chinese government&#39;s effort must be noticed. Their controversial policy of manipulating the overall internet environment definitely will have negative impacts on certain developments of the network. But on the other hand, the special policy also prevents Chinese companies being crushed by international network companies which can subsequently lead to better and more stable occupations offered to people, especially those from poor backgrounds. Moreover, since the Chinese government has so much power compared to another country, it can implement massive measures to optimize the Internet infrastructures. With the endeavor of government, there is a growing number of Chinese citizens who are connected to the Internet. Thus, generally speaking, I think a more positive future of Chinese Internet and its significant impacts on individuals can be sighted.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">(1) iPhone 3G: 10 Years Later</h2>

<h3 id="toc_4">Why I chose this article:</h3>

<p>I am a fan of technology. Therefore reading articles about technology will activate my motivation better compared to other articles.</p>

<h3 id="toc_5">Reflection:</h3>

<p>This is actually a bit easy for me and the structure is apparent to see, although I can learn some words and sentences. Maybe next time I will try a more complex source of technology articles.</p>

<h3 id="toc_6">Summary of the articles:</h3>

<p>10 years ago, an astounding work of art and technology came out: iPhone3G. This is a product added with loads of new functions while maintaining the acknowledged features of original iPhone. It provided customers with faster networking, more comfortable feel as well as a more reasonable price. These things together created a legend of selling 1 million iPhone within 1 week. And yet this is only the start of the Apple empire.</p>

<h2 id="toc_9">(2) Taming the tiger mother (from The Economist)</h2>

<h3 id="toc_10">Why I chose this article:</h3>

<p>As I&#39;ve mentioned before, the MacStories&#39;s article is a bit easy. Thus Economist seems to be a better choice.</p>

<h3 id="toc_11">Reflection:</h3>

<p>The Economist has more complex words that can precisely convey the ideas. Additionally, their writers are all very sophisticated and their sentence structures are extremely natural. So, I think this is one of my greatest choices for English reading.</p>

<h3 id="toc_12">Summary of the articles:</h3>

<p>Nowadays, students in China are suffering from a malformed education system which emphasize heavily on core subjects. Their parents, out of nervousness, will automatically send them to tutoring agencies for extra learnings. Chinese students may excel in tests like PISA, but that is the result of particular emphasis on subjects like math and science. Being exposed to such education system, students have two main problems: excessive homework burden and health issues. Therefore, Ministry of Education released its first &quot;comprehensive learning assessment&quot; to cope with current situation of lacking assessment on general abilities and pupils&#39; overloaded work. This is a well-intentioned policy. However, it still hasn&#39;t touch the root of this phenomenon, namely, the fear of cruel Zhongkao Exam. The next step for Chinese education shall be how to solve that.</p>
