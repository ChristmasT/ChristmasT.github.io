<h2 id="toc_4">Sentences:</h2></li>
</ol>

<p>1.It is an overwhelming need economy that is serving an underprivileged population, which has been separated for 30 years from China&#39;s economic boom.</p>

<p>Translation: 这是一个为弱势群体服务的巨大需求经济，却被中国经济繁荣的30年排除在外。</p>

<p>2.Wherever this alternative fuel exists, be it in China or Africa, Southeast Asia or American heartland. We should endeavor to follow it with capital and with effort, driving both economic and societal impact all over the world.</p>

<p>Translation:  无论这种替代方式存在于何处，在中国或者非洲，东南亚或者美国心脏地带。我们应该用资本和努力来实现这一目标，驱动全球经济和社会影响。</p>

<h2 id="toc_5">Review and thinking:</h2>

<p>China nowadays has increasingly significant status in the international network system. The most apparent reason is China is a country with 1.4 billion citizens. Therefore, even a tiny origin can stir a mass disturbance on the Internet which can be either positive or negative. Thus countless opportunities can be found in the phase when China is developing. However, instead of merely emphasize on how enormous Chinese Internet marketplace is. The speech stressed more on the facility the Internet can offer to those impecunious families with more alternatives. The Internet is offering billions of people with plentiful work positions as well as more advanced education within the speed of life. For those who came from metropolises, accessing to the Internet may be a rather easy task. Nevertheless, their ease may never be reachable for unprivileged individuals, speaking of which Chinese government&#39;s effort must be noticed. Their controversial policy of manipulating the overall internet environment definitely will have negative impacts on certain developments of the network. But on the other hand, the special policy also prevents Chinese companies being crushed by international network companies which can subsequently lead to better and more stable occupations offered to people, especially those from poor backgrounds. Moreover, since the Chinese government has so much power compared to another country, it can implement massive measures to optimize the Internet infrastructures. With the endeavor of government, there is a growing number of Chinese citizens who are connected to the Internet. Thus, generally speaking, I think a more positive future of Chinese Internet and its significant impacts on individuals can be sighted.</p>
