<p>{Origin}: &quot;Enjoy&quot; life<br/>
{Significance}: Education can shape one in a either positive or negative way depends on pupils themselves.<br/>

<p>In these days studying is considered as a trouble by majority of young students, as they only want to enjoy their lives and consider study to be unimportant. Our younger generation has taken everything for granted and do not hold high value for education in their minds.<br/>
Whenever the time comes to study, a student’s mood sinks down and all the energy vanishes. This results in more time being consumed in learning that work due to lesser concentration. This issue needs to be addressed by parents and teachers in a productive manner, not simply forcing their children to more hours of studying or getting tuition after schools.<br/>
There should be some counseling in a way that explains to children that studying is one of the natural things to do in this world, as education makes a man, so can the lack of education break a man. They should be told that if studying is compulsory and necessary then why not do it with an enthusiasm similar to playing sports or performing some other activities and hobbies.</p>

Go for a walk – even some exercise is better than none and it gives you a chance to think, contemplate, or just be.<br/>
Daily quiet time – take ten to twenty minutes to unwind, relax, meditate or have a bath, with no interruptions from the phone, TV, kids or family.<br/>

<p>URL: <a href="http://www.positivecalm.com/positive-thinking-attitude/">http://www.positivecalm.com/positive-thinking-attitude/</a></p>

<p>{Origin}: lack of motivation of action</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The average person will not make any effort to do the change required in order to change their &#39;sad&#39; circumstances, and so they better complain and moan about all the unjust in the world and how they are the victims of everything that happens to them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every morning when you wake up think of 5 reasons to be grateful for… Why in the morning?The morning is the most difficult time to get you into a mood of thinking positive, it will uplift your mood immediately and you will start a day with a positive state of mind. <br/>
Same for the night</p>

<p>{Solution}:</p>

<ol>
<li>Monitor your thoughts. Mind is like a garden where thoughts can be beautiful flowers or garden weeds. Thoughts are energy, the energy tends to transform in material things. Use this to your advantage – encourage positive thinking. Slowly begin to substitute negative thoughts with more optimistic ones. Stop worrying. We have 30,000-75,000 thoughts per day, most of them are nonproductive, worrying thoughts. If the thoughts don’t improve our state of mind, get rid of them.</li>
<li>Be mindful. Live in the moment. Pay attention and enjoy the experiences you have right this moment.</li>
<li>Always strive to be a good person, do the right thing. Be helpful.</li>
<li>Have a sense of humor. Laughter is a great stress reducer. Be playful, don’t take yourself too seriously.</li>
<li>Take care of your health: eat right, exercise.</li>
<li>Slow down. Take time to plan your actions. Stop making decisions on autopilot. Take all the decision that you make automatically and reevaluate your actions, there may be a better solution.</li>
<li>Connect with others.</li>
<li>Be thankful for the good things in your life.</li>
<li>Have goals; know where you are headed.</li>
<li>Evaluate once a year your positions. Are you happy with your job? Are you happy with your relationships? Make adjustments- fix it or let it go.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="toc_6">Positive Attitude Is a State of Mind You Can Adopt</h4>

<p>URL: <a href="https://www.successconsciousness.com/positive_attitude_thinking.htm">https://www.successconsciousness.com/positive_attitude_thinking.htm</a></p>

<p>{Symptom of positiveness}:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People with a positive frame of mind think about possibilities, growth, expansion and success. They expect happiness, health, love and good relationships. They think in terms of,<br/>
&#39;I can&#39;<br/>
&#39;I am able&#39;<br/>
&#39;I will succeed&#39;.<br/>
People with a positive attitude are not daunted by failures and obstacles. If things don&#39;t turn out well or as expected, they will try again. They approach what they do with a positive thinking frame of mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>{Solution}:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Read inspiring and motivating stories about people who achieved success. This will inspire and motivate you, as well as show you what they actually did, so you can implement it in your life.</li>
<li>Use affirmations. These positive statements will sink into your subconscious mind, which in turn will guide, motivate, and inspire you to tale action.</li>
<li>This also applies to visualization, the creation of mental scenes of what you want to achieve or have.</li>
<li>You don&#39;t have to allow negative thoughts to thrive in your mind. You can put an end to this habit. Be on guard to replace you negative thoughts with constructive ones. Start paying attention to your thoughts, and as negative thoughts start circulating in your mind, calmly, and without using force, replace them with constructive, happy and positive thoughts. You can make great changes in your life if you play the role of the doorkeeper of your mind.</li>
<li>Take action, don&#39;t be passive, in small matters and in big ones. If you keep busy doing things, there will be less likelihood of becoming negative, and a greater likelihood of being positive.</li>
