                        	<p>According to Merriam Webster, culture is the collection of traditions, values or social activities related to certain fields or particular societies. With the majority of citizens being Chinese, Singapore, a tiny yet developed country, has cultures blended with numerous Chinese elements. Meanwhile, being influenced by various ethnic groups, Singapore has found its own way of forming its unique culture with discrepancies between it and China.<br/>
While Singaporean and Chinese cultures both have acceptance of Chinese festivals, there are significant differences in terms of their time spent with families and senses of security.</p>

<p>To start with, Singapore has kept a great atmosphere of Chinese customs, especially Chinese festivals. For instance, during the most famous and momentous Chinese New Year Festival, Chinese will decorate their streets and houses for celebrating the occasion. Likewise, some lion dance troupes can be seen in Singapore with Singapore drums to accompany the performance (Tan, n.a). Additionally, the essence of the core values of Chinese festivals has not changed like family getting together on Mid-Autumn Festivals. This reflects both countries have respects to traditional Chinese festivals and their homogeneous inner cores. Thus it is not surprising for Chinese to find cultural affinity in Singapore (Charissa Yong, 2016). To sum up, Singapore has shown an amazing correspondence with China in celebrating Chinese festivals with acceptance of the internal values.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, although family reunion on festival has implied the great importance Singaporeans and Chinese attached to family, the ways and time they spent with families are not the same. According to a survey done by Channel NewsAsia’s (2016), the significance of family ranked highly among Singaporeans. However, Singapore is a developed country with intense competitions in companies and academies. Thereby to  excel in academic or work fields, both students and employees should work hard to meet the requirements, the result of which is less time spent with family. Only half of the respondents said they spend more than 36 hours a week with their families according to Tho Ee Mine’s survey(2016). A typical phenomenon is Singaporeans tend to eat dinner separately, unlike Chinese eating together on one table as a family. Therefore, yet both Chinese and Singaporeans emphasize strongly on family, certain distinction exists in terms of time spent with family.</p>

<!--https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=VSeJAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA97&dq=Huang+Na&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj-l9flzr7dAhWMO48KHf2UBaMQ6AEIODAC#v=onepage&q=Huang%20Na&f=false-->

<p>Apart from family time, another disparity between two countries’ cultures can be identified from senses of security.  It is uncommon to see one serious case related to personal security in Singapore for the reason Singaporeans highly value safeness of themselves as well as others. In every aspect, safety is inviolable in Singapore. Hence Singaporeans would find it astonishing and sorrowful hearing the grievous news of Huang Na’s murder (Futt, 2013). Situations are different in China, where concepts of security in different regions vary a a lot with different education and economic conditions. Most of time, having a stable occupation to earn a living is the most critical security in a Chinese citizen&#39;s mind. Correspondingly, awareness of personal security is not as strong as Singaporeans. In short, senses of security differ greatly between Chinese and Singaporeans due to disparate concepts of security.  </p>

<p>In conclusion, characteristic traits exist in both Chinese and Singaporean cultures. Some like festival celebrations are similar, some like family time and  safety conceptions are not. There is no superior one between these two cultures since two countries all seek their own culture path towards a better society. Respect must be reserved regarding the resemblance and distinction so as to consider them objectively.</p>

Two articles from The Economist and Alex Renton discuss about the origins and effects of ocean acidification. Since factories produced massive carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, oceans will irrevocably absorb them with results including both positive and negative influence on the world as a whole.</p>

<h4 id="toc_2">Studying with a positive attitude</h4>

<p>{Origin}: &quot;Enjoy&quot; life<br/>
{Significance}: Education can shape one in a either positive or negative way depends on pupils themselves.<br/>

<p>In these days studying is considered as a trouble by majority of young students, as they only want to enjoy their lives and consider study to be unimportant. Our younger generation has taken everything for granted and do not hold high value for education in their minds.<br/>
Whenever the time comes to study, a student’s mood sinks down and all the energy vanishes. This results in more time being consumed in learning that work due to lesser concentration. This issue needs to be addressed by parents and teachers in a productive manner, not simply forcing their children to more hours of studying or getting tuition after schools.<br/>
There should be some counseling in a way that explains to children that studying is one of the natural things to do in this world, as education makes a man, so can the lack of education break a man. They should be told that if studying is compulsory and necessary then why not do it with an enthusiasm similar to playing sports or performing some other activities and hobbies.</p>

<p>Lack of sleep can have various severe damage to human&#39;s body. Firstly, sleep deficiency can give rise to chaos of chemical distribution and further more to unstable mood. Secondly, short of sleep is part of reasons of workers&#39; inattention which is the main cause of some tragic cases. Similarly, drivers are less likely to focus without sufficient sleep. Lastly, sleep absence caused by fanaticism or overloaded work may result in profound harm on health. Therefore excessive work and school plan should really be altered to ensure basic sleep requirement.</p>

<p>Genetically modified food refer to the food whose genes have been changed by the scientists. When it comes to food with altered genes, people often have diverse opinions considering its effects. Firstly, transgenic food must has benefits since scientists develop them with positive intention. Those food can collect superior genes together to prevent themselves from being devastated by pests or herbicides (Food, Genetically Modified, 2014). The added genes can also stimulate the plants to have more nutrition, the result of which is better flavor and quality(Bosch, n.d). Moreover, it can help reserving the limited resource on earth such as water and energy(Bosch, n.d). Nevertheless, such highly controversial products indeed have some demerits. A plausible inference is variations caused by genes transformation might occur. Thus, concerned common sense no longer makes sense facing those food, especially to individuals who are allergic to certain type of food (Schneider and Schneider, 2009). Integration of two disparate comestible potentially results in severe consequences without mention of new constituent. More seriously, food engineers themselves might unconsciously compose some toxic chemicals during the process which certainly does massive harm to citizens&#39; health (Vrain, 2013). In conclusion, while Genetically modified foods provide humans with foods with better resilience to possible damage and greater quality, they also give rise to worry about potential toxin and allergy it brings because of reform of genes and protein sequences. </p>
