<h3 id="toc_4">Why I chose this article:</h3>

<p>I am a fan of technology. Therefore reading articles about technology will activate my motivation better compared to other articles.</p>

<h3 id="toc_5">Reflection:</h3>

<p>This is actually a bit easy for me and the structure is apparent to see, although I can learn some words and sentences. Maybe next time I will try a more complex source of technology articles.</p>

<p>10 years ago, an astounding work of art and technology came out: iPhone3G. This is a product added with loads of new functions while maintaining the acknowledged features of original iPhone. It provided customers with faster networking, more comfortable feel as well as a more reasonable price. These things together created a legend of selling 1 million iPhone within 1 week. And yet this is only the start of the Apple empire.</p>

<h2 id="toc_9">(2) Taming the tiger mother (from The Economist)</h2>

<h3 id="toc_10">Why I chose this article:</h3>

<p>As I&#39;ve mentioned before, the MacStories&#39;s article is a bit easy. Thus Economist seems to be a better choice.</p>

<h3 id="toc_11">Reflection:</h3>

<p>The Economist has more complex words that can precisely convey the ideas. Additionally, their writers are all very sophisticated and their sentence structures are extremely natural. So, I think this is one of my greatest choices for English reading.</p>

<p>Nowadays, students in China are suffering from a malformed education system which emphasize heavily on core subjects. Their parents, out of nervousness, will automatically send them to tutoring agencies for extra learnings. Chinese students may excel in tests like PISA, but that is the result of particular emphasis on subjects like math and science. Being exposed to such education system, students have two main problems: excessive homework burden and health issues. Therefore, Ministry of Education released its first &quot;comprehensive learning assessment&quot; to cope with current situation of lacking assessment on general abilities and pupils&#39; overloaded work. This is a well-intentioned policy. However, it still hasn&#39;t touch the root of this phenomenon, namely, the fear of cruel Zhongkao Exam. The next step for Chinese education shall be how to solve that.</p>

                        	<p>Currently, I settle in a city pervaded with English and therefore not only daily communication,  but also academic writing requires me to be proficient in English. My weakness is I sometimes will shift away from the central topic and my word usage is occasionally inaccurate. Thus writing and reading are the main focus for me in phase one. Of course, additionally I will continue practicing my listening and speaking to better fit in the environment. Here are my goals for English studying.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Goals:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Capable of writing sophisticated academic essays. (better structures, word usage and sentence logic)</li>
<li>Read more English books or articles to get familiar with some common words, phrases and structures. (Including but not limited to TED, Economist and book reading)</li>
<li>Improve impromptu speech ability (watching speeches and seize every opportunity to present a speech)</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are some of the measures I will take to make me excel in English.<br/>
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-q0Kyr3VwKE0/W3jXTIzoJPI/AAAAAAAACXA/hXxE1CIM1ikGINKbHrH8ydKu5FmncH-TACHMYCw/I/Weekly%2BSchedule.png" alt="Weekly Schedule"/></p>

<ol>
<li>Through experience of mine, I found out that reading is the most efficient way to memorize words because I can naturally recall the sentence from which I can infer the meanings. Therefore I distribute some time for various English reading materials including Economist, tech articles (Macstories) and English books.</li>
<li>Mere reading is not enough for sure, I need writing to consolidate the words or expressions I recently learn. So I will take English writing assignments seriously. If I have vacant time, I will compose one or two technology reviews and post that on my blog.</li>
<li>In my opinion, listening and speaking are closely combined. Thus, I will watch some English videos to improve these abilities. As a matter of fact, my listening and speaking are dramatically improved via watching Youtube video without subtitles before I came to Singapore. Besides, I can learn certain speaking structures or words through watching English videos. </li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, plans above might have minor changes according to the assignment or activities. However, the general goal stays the same: improving my English capability.</p>

<p>Lack of sleep can have various severe damage to human&#39;s body. Firstly, sleep deficiency can give rise to chaos of chemical distribution and further more to unstable mood. Secondly, short of sleep is part of reasons of workers&#39; inattention which is the main cause of some tragic cases. Similarly, drivers are less likely to focus without sufficient sleep. Lastly, sleep absence caused by fanaticism or overloaded work may result in profound harm on health. Therefore excessive work and school plan should really be altered to ensure basic sleep requirement.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Section B:</h2>

<p>Genetically modified food refer to the food whose genes have been changed by the scientists. When it comes to food with altered genes, people often have diverse opinions considering its effects. Firstly, transgenic food must has benefits since scientists develop them with positive intention. Those food can collect superior genes together to prevent themselves from being devastated by pests or herbicides (Food, Genetically Modified, 2014). The added genes can also stimulate the plants to have more nutrition, the result of which is better flavor and quality(Bosch, n.d). Moreover, it can help reserving the limited resource on earth such as water and energy(Bosch, n.d). Nevertheless, such highly controversial products indeed have some demerits. A plausible inference is variations caused by genes transformation might occur. Thus, concerned common sense no longer makes sense facing those food, especially to individuals who are allergic to certain type of food (Schneider and Schneider, 2009). Integration of two disparate comestible potentially results in severe consequences without mention of new constituent. More seriously, food engineers themselves might unconsciously compose some toxic chemicals during the process which certainly does massive harm to citizens&#39; health (Vrain, 2013). In conclusion, while Genetically modified foods provide humans with foods with better resilience to possible damage and greater quality, they also give rise to worry about potential toxin and allergy it brings because of reform of genes and protein sequences. </p>

<p><strong>Synthesis:</strong></p>

<p>A rainforest is a forest located in the tropical part of the earth which consists of numerous densely arranged tall trees. Recent years have witnessed the recession of rainforest: from 30% of the earth in 1950 to 6% in 2002 due to humans&#39; exploitation in resources. Four reasons can be found to justify the significance of preserving rainforest.</p>

<ol>
<li>Firstly, rainforest offer natural livelihood for tropical citizens with not only food but also material wealth and even sacred belief. Thus once rainforest is spoiled, those civilizations will no longer exist.</li>
<li>Secondly, rainforest hides great amount of medicinal value. A prominent example is that there are over 2000 tropical rainforest plants can be used to deter cancer. Also rainforest plants contribute to about 40% prescribed drugs in US.</li>
<li>Thirdly, rainforest are crucial on keeping the water and soil resource, without which natural catastrophe will happen.</li>
<li>last but not least, as it is known to all, rainforest is the lung of the earth. Through absorbing of CO2 and emission of O2, rainforest can remarkably improve the air quality as well as restrain the climate change.<br/>
Therefore, rainforest plays an indispensable role in humans&#39; ecosystem which explains why it must be preserved.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="toc_1">Exercise 4: Synthesis - Globalisation</h2>

<p><strong>Synthesis</strong><br/>
Globalization is defined as a trend to unify the world in aspects like economy, culture and technology which started as early as European colonial era (Ellwood, 2001) which has been boosted up in recent years by moldering development of technology, sophisticated transportation and unrestricted flow of money. (Longman Dictionary, 2000)</p>

<p>These are few prominent merits of globalization. The most evident one is that it provides the world with easier and wider contact including communication in both prevailing culture and distinct commodities. Barbie dolls, fast food and hip-pop can find their place to survive. So can characteristic specialty like Thai, Szechuan and Indian food (Ransome, 1997)</p>

<p>Nonetheless, some severe impacts had been brought to the world by globalization. Firstly, it gave rise to the increasingly broadened wealth gap. Authority of determination had been aggregated in the hands of minority. Secondly, ethnic culture had been ravaged by the invasion of foreign culture. Moreover, globalization is also the criminal of devastating of environment, regional conflicts and deficiency of sense of collectivity.</p>

<p>At present, governments are losing dominance on globalization and therefore need to regulate systems and future arrangement to coordinate with drastic transformation brought by globalization. Only taking care of occupation human’s basic need and economy as well as preservation of ecosystems can government ensure globalization is on the right track.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Paragraph:</h3>

<p>Film editor <u>is</u>  a person who can proficiently cut a film or short movie with professional applications and make profit from it. Nowadays, it <u>is</u> significantly important for unprofessional individuals to condense their special memory into a short trailer. Therefore there <u>is</u> no surprise to find out that film editors can gain great amount of money within short amount of time. However, the images for film editors <u>are</u> usually some overweighted persons with red and sleepy eyes. As a matter of fact, that <u>is</u> not always the case. Since these people are willing to devote their time for editing film, they must find editing interesting and worthwhile. Furthermore, they can also maintain a good shape through working out regularly in the interval of two orders. Hence being a film editor may <u>be</u> one of my favorite occupations in the future.</p>

<p>Taking note with electronic devices and traditionally taking note with pen and book.</p>

<h3 id="toc_5">Paragraph:</h3>

<p>Today is 2018 when everything is trending in becoming digital. Thus, it is extremely difficult for college students to choose if they should take notes with their tablets and laptops. Note-taking on electronic devices has way more convenience in transferring data through cloud service. Also it <u>has</u> a prominent advantage that traditional books don&#39;t <u>have</u> which is the weight students take to class are significantly lighter. Nevertheless, that doesn&#39;t mean the traditional way is an outdated way. Countless researches internationally <u>have</u> shown that handwriting <u>has</u> more assistance in helping students to memorize knowledge. What&#39;s more is that with a  mere set of pen and notebook, listeners are less likely to be distracted by the messages popping up. Therefore in conclusion, these two ways of taking note both have their pros and cons, what undergraduates should do is wisely choose the tools in different circumstances. After all, the method is not the thing that matters, the knowledge is.</p>
