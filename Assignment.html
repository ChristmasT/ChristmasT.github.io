                  <h1>Online Magazine</h1>
                  <div class="a-content">
                      
                      <div class="a-content-text">
                        
                        	<p>Believe it or not, statistics show there are now about 2.62 billion social media users in the world (Tableau, 2018). Specifically, when it comes to the usage among students, the landscape is dramatic: a staggering 90% of students use social media (Perrin, 2015), and there is a 78% increase from 12% ten years ago (Perrin, 2015). Social media is defined as various effects made by the collectives of online communications channels dedicated to content-sharing and interaction. With such a huge user group of students, the negative consequences of social media are so grave that cannot be neglected. Take students in America for example, according to different aspects of their lives, the consequences can be categorized into three parts: academic performance, online safety, and personal relationships.</p>

<p>To start with, being distracted by social media and relying too much on grammar-checking software on social media can result in slumps in academic performance. According to Dunn (2017), students who are easily distracted by social media perform dramatically worse than those who are not. Notifications from Facebook or WeChat grasp people’s attention from their current task. As a result, process like learning which requires high consistency will be significantly harmed. Additionally, texting on social media make students rely more on online grammar checking tools and more careless of grammar and sentence structures (Hopkins, 2017). Grammarly is a convenient software for students to automatically check grammar mistakes. Consequently, students naturally reckon that grammar does not matter. However, reliance on it makes it harder for students to compose correct sentences in an exam since no computers or phones are allowed, the result of which is surely lower grades. In short, over-reliance on social media will contribute to poorer academic grades due to their distraction and facility to correct grammar.</p>

<p>Besides, due to the insidious danger and its feature of anonymity, social media poses a great threat to students’ safety. It has become apparent criminals rely on social media to engage susceptible and vulnerable students who lack the awareness of safety, parents’ guardianship, and are likely to share identifying information to strangers, that they will get scammed or be put in physical danger (Center City Pediatrics, 2018). Take cyberbullying for an example, statistics evolved by the US students reveals 55% of them have witnessed cyberbullying (Kim, 2014). 26% of female students say they have been stalked online, while 25% say they are under online sexual harassment (Duggan, 2014). A 12-year-old Florida girl committed suicide after she was bullied online by other girls through anonymous social media websites (Al Jazeera America, 2013). In most cases, cyberbullied students will not confide in their parents, which worsens the problem (Kim, 2014). To conclude, the safety on social media, including the reveal of information and cyberbullying, has already become an urgent problem with a huge scope especially for students.</p>

<p>Furthermore, social media also cause damage to interpersonal relationships. Due to social media, a reduction of face-to-face communication is caused, which results in a dive of friendship quality. According to Maintaining Close Friendships Requires Face-to-Face Contact (2016), using social media reduces the time of face to face communication. However, communications in reality help to build trust and boost relationships (What Are the Benefits of Face to Face Communication, n.d.). Moreover, jealousy brought by social media is also responsible for a more distant friendship. Many students feel jealous when using social media, as is pointed out by Tips to Avoid Letting Social Media Ruin Your Family Life (2017),  42 percent of people are jealous of things posted online by their friends.  Subsequently, when one gets jealous of a friend, one tends to hold back from the friendship, and the friendship is harmed ( How Jealousy Can Poison a Friendship, 2015). Therefore, using social media causes jealousy and a lack of communication in real life, hence debases the quality of friendships.</p>

<p>Social media have greatly improved people’s living standard, the problems posed by it should nevertheless be noted. Students get distracted by social media, rely on grammar checkers, expose to the criminals, and suffer from worsened friendships. Social media have created severe problems, to quit social media, or at least reduce the using of it, may be a good option.</p>

                        	<h2 id="toc_0">Introduction</h2>

<p>According to Henriques (2014), almost every college counseling center director reported that the number of students who have been diagnosed with mental illness is on the rise. This serious phenomenon has raised people&#39;s increasing awareness of students&#39; mental health. Mental health is of crucial importance to a college student since college is the place where significant impacts on individuals take place. However, even if an undergraduate is in a terrible mental condition, little care is given to improve mental health, the result of which is undoubtedly slumps in academic performance (Gorczynski, 2018). Thereby, in order to have ideal grades and enjoyable life in universities, an undergraduate should give top priority to their mental health in universities (Wakeford, 2017). In this case, the most optimal mental state is positive attitude and peace of mind, which refers to a healthy mental state in which one is optimistic and willing to act towards solving problems without anxiety or negativity. In his article, Wakeford(2017) has identified academic stress, isolation, balancing work and study, financial difficulties and living independently as the main aspects of mental health. Nonetheless, things might be slightly different among NUS undergraduates. Aiming to find out the mental health conditions of NUS undergraduates, we had decided to investigate them through surveys. Through investigating about the factors causing happiness or stress and how our respondents cope with difficult situations in daily life, our group have got to know more about the general mental states of NUS undergraduates and some minor difference between students with different gender, faculty or grade.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Methodology</h2>

<p>We had investigated 180 undergraduates in Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences(FASS), Faculty of Engineering(ENG), Faculty of Science(FoS), School of Design and Environment(SDE), School of Computing(SoC) and School of Business(BIZ). The researchers had been divided into 6 groups. Each group is responsible for surveying 30 students of one faculty through face-to-face interview or distributing questionnaires. The questions mainly focus on the origin of stress and happiness and the undergraduates&#39; attitudes towards daily life.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Topic sentence:</h2>

<p>Excessive social media usage can result in drops in academic performance in various ways.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Supporting elaboration/explanation:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Students will be easily distracted by social media (Dunn, 2011).</li>
<li>Texting on social media will make pupil more regardless of grammar and sentence structures and rely more on online grammar checking tools (Hopkins, 2017).</li>
<li>Nowadays, the Internet has almost made all information accessible. Thus, students will less likely to retain and remember the knowledge since they can check it out anytime on the Internet.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="toc_3">Examples:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Pop-up messages from Facebook or WeChat grasp one&#39;s attention from his or her current task, making it harder to concentrate.</li>
<li> Grammarly is a convenient way for students to check grammar mistakes. However, reliance on it make it harder for student to compose correct sentence in an exam since no computers or phones are allowed in that occasion.</li>
<li>Take Quora as an example, once a specific question is typed in, the answer will come out within several milliseconds. Therefore, students feel unnecessary to emphasize on learning and retaining information.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="toc_4">Concluding statement:</h2>

<p>In short, over-reliance on social media will contribute to poorer academic grades due to their distractions, regardlessness of grammar and convenience providing answers.</p>
