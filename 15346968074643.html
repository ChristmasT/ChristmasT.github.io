<h2 id="toc_3">(1) iPhone 3G: 10 Years Later</h2>

<h3 id="toc_4">Why I chose this article:</h3>

<p>I am a fan of technology. Therefore reading articles about technology will activate my motivation better compared to other articles.</p>

<h3 id="toc_5">Reflection:</h3>

<p>This is actually a bit easy for me and the structure is apparent to see, although I can learn some words and sentences. Maybe next time I will try a more complex source of technology articles.</p>

<h3 id="toc_6">Summary of the articles:</h3>

<p>10 years ago, an astounding work of art and technology came out: iPhone3G. This is a product added with loads of new functions while maintaining the acknowledged features of original iPhone. It provided customers with faster networking, more comfortable feel as well as a more reasonable price. These things together created a legend of selling 1 million iPhone within 1 week. And yet this is only the start of the Apple empire.</p>

<h2 id="toc_9">(2) Taming the tiger mother (from The Economist)</h2>

<h3 id="toc_10">Why I chose this article:</h3>

<p>As I&#39;ve mentioned before, the MacStories&#39;s article is a bit easy. Thus Economist seems to be a better choice.</p>

<h3 id="toc_11">Reflection:</h3>

<p>The Economist has more complex words that can precisely convey the ideas. Additionally, their writers are all very sophisticated and their sentence structures are extremely natural. So, I think this is one of my greatest choices for English reading.</p>

<h3 id="toc_12">Summary of the articles:</h3>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jXcrH9-LcvE/W3lz_Yzal5I/AAAAAAAACX0/3wIiiqL-Oi4cObjYUVLcC1alcEgojq_qACHMYCw/I/%25255BUNSET%25255D" alt="屏幕快照 1"/></p>

<p>Nowadays, students in China are suffering from a malformed education system which emphasize heavily on core subjects. Their parents, out of nervousness, will automatically send them to tutoring agencies for extra learnings. Chinese students may excel in tests like PISA, but that is the result of particular emphasis on subjects like math and science. Being exposed to such education system, students have two main problems: excessive homework burden and health issues. Therefore, Ministry of Education released its first &quot;comprehensive learning assessment&quot; to cope with current situation of lacking assessment on general abilities and pupils&#39; overloaded work. This is a well-intentioned policy. However, it still hasn&#39;t touch the root of this phenomenon, namely, the fear of cruel Zhongkao Exam. The next step for Chinese education shall be how to solve that.</p>
