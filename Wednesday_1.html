		<h1>8.15 Paraphrase, Summary & Synthesis</h1>

		<h2 id="toc_0">Exercise 3: Synthesis - Rainforests</h2>

<p><strong>Synthesis:</strong></p>

<p>A rainforest is a forest located in the tropical part of the earth which consists of numerous densely arranged tall trees. Recent years have witnessed the recession of rainforest: from 30% of the earth in 1950 to 6% in 2002 due to humans&#39; exploitation in resources. Four reasons can be found to justify the significance of preserving rainforest.</p>

<ol>
<li>Firstly, rainforest offer natural livelihood for tropical citizens with not only food but also material wealth and even sacred belief. Thus once rainforest is spoiled, those civilizations will no longer exist.</li>
<li>Secondly, rainforest hides great amount of medicinal value. A prominent example is that there are over 2000 tropical rainforest plants can be used to deter cancer. Also rainforest plants contribute to about 40% prescribed drugs in US.</li>
<li>Thirdly, rainforest are crucial on keeping the water and soil resource, without which natural catastrophe will happen.</li>
<li>last but not least, as it is known to all, rainforest is the lung of the earth. Through absorbing of CO2 and emission of O2, rainforest can remarkably improve the air quality as well as restrain the climate change.<br/>
Therefore, rainforest plays an indispensable role in humans&#39; ecosystem which explains why it must be preserved.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="toc_1">Exercise 4: Synthesis - Globalisation</h2>

<p><strong>Synthesis</strong><br/>
Globalization is defined as a trend to unify the world in aspects like economy, culture and technology which started as early as European colonial era (Ellwood, 2001) which has been boosted up in recent years by moldering development of technology, sophisticated transportation and unrestricted flow of money. (Longman Dictionary, 2000)</p>

<p>These are few prominent merits of globalization. The most evident one is that it provides the world with easier and wider contact including communication in both prevailing culture and distinct commodities. Barbie dolls, fast food and hip-pop can find their place to survive. So can characteristic specialty like Thai, Szechuan and Indian food (Ransome, 1997)</p>

<p>Nonetheless, some severe impacts had been brought to the world by globalization. Firstly, it gave rise to the increasingly broadened wealth gap. Authority of determination had been aggregated in the hands of minority. Secondly, ethnic culture had been ravaged by the invasion of foreign culture. Moreover, globalization is also the criminal of devastating of environment, regional conflicts and deficiency of sense of collectivity.</p>

<p>At present, governments are losing dominance on globalization and therefore need to regulate systems and future arrangement to coordinate with drastic transformation brought by globalization. Only taking care of occupation humanâ€™s basic need and economy as well as preservation of ecosystems can government ensure globalization is on the right track.</p>
