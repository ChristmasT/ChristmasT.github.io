      <div class="article-content">
      <p>Believe it or not, statistics show there are now about 2.62 billion social media users in the world (Tableau, 2018). Specifically, when it comes to the usage among students, the landscape is dramatic: a staggering 90% of students use social media (Perrin, 2015), and there is a 78% increase from 12% ten years ago (Perrin, 2015). Social media is defined as various effects made by the collectives of online communications channels dedicated to content-sharing and interaction. With such a huge user group of students, the negative consequences of social media are so grave that cannot be neglected. Take students in America for example, according to different aspects of their lives, the consequences can be categorized into three parts: academic performance, online safety, and personal relationships.</p>

<p>To start with, being distracted by social media and relying too much on grammar-checking software on social media can result in slumps in academic performance. According to Dunn (2017), students who are easily distracted by social media perform dramatically worse than those who are not. Notifications from Facebook or WeChat grasp people’s attention from their current task. As a result, process like learning which requires high consistency will be significantly harmed. Additionally, texting on social media make students rely more on online grammar checking tools and more careless of grammar and sentence structures (Hopkins, 2017). Grammarly is a convenient software for students to automatically check grammar mistakes. Consequently, students naturally reckon that grammar does not matter. However, reliance on it makes it harder for students to compose correct sentences in an exam since no computers or phones are allowed, the result of which is surely lower grades. In short, over-reliance on social media will contribute to poorer academic grades due to their distraction and facility to correct grammar.</p>

<p>Besides, due to the insidious danger and its feature of anonymity, social media poses a great threat to students’ safety. It has become apparent criminals rely on social media to engage susceptible and vulnerable students who lack the awareness of safety, parents’ guardianship, and are likely to share identifying information to strangers, that they will get scammed or be put in physical danger (Center City Pediatrics, 2018). Take cyberbullying for an example, statistics evolved by the US students reveals 55% of them have witnessed cyberbullying (Kim, 2014). 26% of female students say they have been stalked online, while 25% say they are under online sexual harassment (Duggan, 2014). A 12-year-old Florida girl committed suicide after she was bullied online by other girls through anonymous social media websites (Al Jazeera America, 2013). In most cases, cyberbullied students will not confide in their parents, which worsens the problem (Kim, 2014). To conclude, the safety on social media, including the reveal of information and cyberbullying, has already become an urgent problem with a huge scope especially for students.</p>

<p>Furthermore, social media also cause damage to interpersonal relationships. Due to social media, a reduction of face-to-face communication is caused, which results in a dive of friendship quality. According to Maintaining Close Friendships Requires Face-to-Face Contact (2016), using social media reduces the time of face to face communication. However, communications in reality help to build trust and boost relationships (What Are the Benefits of Face to Face Communication, n.d.). Moreover, jealousy brought by social media is also responsible for a more distant friendship. Many students feel jealous when using social media, as is pointed out by Tips to Avoid Letting Social Media Ruin Your Family Life (2017),  42 percent of people are jealous of things posted online by their friends.  Subsequently, when one gets jealous of a friend, one tends to hold back from the friendship, and the friendship is harmed ( How Jealousy Can Poison a Friendship, 2015). Therefore, using social media causes jealousy and a lack of communication in real life, hence debases the quality of friendships.</p>

<p>Social media have greatly improved people’s living standard, the problems posed by it should nevertheless be noted. Students get distracted by social media, rely on grammar checkers, expose to the criminals, and suffer from worsened friendships. Social media have created severe problems, to quit social media, or at least reduce the using of it, may be a good option.</p>
