<p>Originally I saw the translated version of this article on a platform called &quot;One Piece&quot; which I found valuable. Thus I trace back and find the original version on The New York Times and chose it as the material for RLV Logs.</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">Summary of the articles:</h3>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qiA_VHfSLXM/W5UyoSwm0SI/AAAAAAAACkE/lHbn9-mWAzALDnE7lsmqy1Ld7_Admc7lgCHMYCw/I/%255BUNSET%255D" alt="屏幕快照 4"/><br/>
As an incentive for human determination, convenience offers people with more efficient and relaxed method of coping tasks. Bearing &quot;saving-the-efforts&quot; in mind, humans are unconsciously driven by convenience. The revolution of convenience can be traced back in the 20th century when machine helped a lot in saving labor force. However some people resisted it because of the need of self-expression and thereby continued growing their vegetables. Then the second revolution which saw the potential of customization came. Numerous services for individualization came to the market, making self-expression inevitably homogeneous. Struggles may seem trivial in the era of convenience, but they provide individuals with the answer of who they are. In conclusion, while enjoying the convenience multiple tools bring about, one shall never forget the joy of doing something slowly yet happily in those &quot;inconvenient&quot; ways.</p>
