<h1>Individual Report of HL Project</h1>

<h2 id="toc_0">Introduction</h2>

<p>According to Henriques (2014), almost every college counseling center director reported that the number of students who have been diagnosed with mental illness is on the rise. This serious phenomenon has raised people&#39;s increasing awareness of students&#39; mental health. Mental health is of crucial importance to a college student since college is the place where significant impacts on individuals take place. However, even if an undergraduate is in a terrible mental condition, little care is given to improve mental health, the result of which is undoubtedly slumps in academic performance (Gorczynski, 2018). Thereby, in order to have ideal grades and enjoyable life in universities, an undergraduate should give top priority to their mental health in universities (Wakeford, 2017). In this case, the most optimal mental state is positive attitude and peace of mind, which refers to a healthy mental state in which one is optimistic and willing to act towards solving problems without anxiety or negativity. In his article, Wakeford(2017) has identified academic stress, isolation, balancing work and study, financial difficulties and living independently as the main aspects of mental health. Nonetheless, things might be slightly different among NUS undergraduates. Aiming to find out the mental health conditions of NUS undergraduates, we had decided to investigate them through surveys. Through investigating about the factors causing happiness or stress and how our respondents cope with difficult situations in daily life, our group have got to know more about the general mental states of NUS undergraduates and some minor difference between students with different gender, faculty or grade.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Methodology</h2>

<p>We had investigated 180 undergraduates in Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences(FASS), Faculty of Engineering(ENG), Faculty of Science(FoS), School of Design and Environment(SDE), School of Computing(SoC) and School of Business(BIZ). The researchers had been divided into 6 groups. Each group is responsible for surveying 30 students of one faculty through face-to-face interview or distributing questionnaires. The questions mainly focus on the origin of stress and happiness and the undergraduates&#39; attitudes towards daily life.</p>
