<p><em>why am I writing this since I already have an existing self-intro right inside my Bear which I wrote before I came to SG? That is because those words are for the interviewers which include some type of hypocrisy. But this time I want to write some words for myself.</em></p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Newer Version:</h2>

<p>Behold an impressive boy from Zhejiang! My name is Tian Fang, a simple yet loud name given by my parents with expectations of my outgoing characteristics. As a matter of fact, they indeed succeed in shaping my extroverted trait. Thereby getting along with people seems no big deal for me which plays an important role in my quick adaptation to new environments.</p>

<p>What makes me different is my quickness and enthusiasm in learning new things. Just list few here: music, filming, acting and technology. I am the leader of basso part in our school choir and well as the director of the short film produced for my alma mater. Several best actors awards had been awarded to me for my performance in &quot;Peter Pan&quot; &amp; &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, among all of them, I am profoundly fond of computer. My learning journey started when I assembled my first computer. Later I went through learning of computer&#39;s basic structures, circuit design, various programming language and loads of professional apps all by myself. Within the learning process about technology, I found out that technology can be a junction between different knowledge with which I can really make the most of my extensive interests. A very prominent example is the competition held by Apple and Zhejiang University that required not only the profound understanding of programming but also how to present it which involve teamwork, story-telling and film production. Our 1<sup>st</sup>  rank is the best proof of why and how comprehensive abilities matter.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s it! A very brief introduction about me. Frankly, I don&#39;t want to reveal too much about me. For more details about me, you are pretty welcomed to ask. Meanwhile, if I had the chance to know more about you, that will be even better!</p>

                  <h1>How to maintain a healthy lifestyle in Singapore</h1>
                  <div class="a-content">
                      
                      <div class="a-content-text">
                        
                        	<p>Singapore is a highly unfamiliar country to me. The key feature of it is lack of parents&#39; caring. So for the career of studying and further more for the body my parents gave me, I decide to live a healthy life in Singapore.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Sleep</h2>

<p>First and foremost, sleeping is surely something I shall guarantee. As my mother said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sleeping is the base of everything</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s true because without sufficient sleeping, I won&#39;t have the energy to conduct any activities that keep me healthy. The possible results are: drop in academic performance; less hair; black circles around my eyes which are terrifying even just to imagine. Thus thanks to the technology, I scheduled a rather great work and rest time table. When it is time for bed, I will be &quot;compulsorily&quot; sent to the bed to ensure the basic need for sleeping.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Sanitation</h2>

<p>We&#39;ve just had a meeting reminding us about keeping our rooms tidy. And surprisingly lots of things are exactly things that I am doing: I would regularly open my windows and doors in order to gain a better air quality. I would clean my desk and floor from time to time, let alone the good habit of brushing teeth and taking shower. I take these great cleaning habits after my mom which can also be a major part of a healthy lifestyle.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Food</h2>

<p>Within the first year, we will have compulsory meals most of the time. I still remember the words of Prof Tay:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>你们敢敢吃啊!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, for the purpose of filling my belly, I would have extra meals because I believe nobody wants to see a pale face. Despite eating regular meals, another important habit is drinking water. Though I may not feel much even after a long time without any water income, drinking water is highly required to make my body well-functioned. Again, tech helped me with the notifications of my water bottle so that I will take in enough water daily.</p>

<p>Not only sleeping, lots of healthy habits as a whole are the base of everything else. With technology and more importantly the power of habits, I will firmly walk on the road of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.</p>

                  <h1>First impression of PFPR, NUS and Singapore</h1>
                  <div class="a-content">

<p>Once the route chosen, you&#39;ll have to walk it through, even on your knees.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the first week I spent in Singapore. Loads of objects, events and people emerged in front of my eyes, among them, some are familiar, some are not.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Campus</h2>

<p>Frankly speaking, I was expecting a rather small campus of NUS since it was way nearer to the downtown compared to NTU. However, I was still amazed by how  big this campus is. Inside the campus, a whole well-functioned system was settled: Free shuttles, great NUH, various canteens, etc. Hope I can get familiar with it as fast as I can.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Multiracial</h2>

<p>Within this several days, I&#39;ve encountered lots of people from all around the globe. Firstly, among SM2 students, there are students from different provinces. So naturally, I am able to hear various types of mandarin with different accents which is pretty fun. Secondly, in Singapore, I can met people from other races. For instance, I met a Malaysian student who can speak mandarin quite fluent on the bus. I could already feel the multicultural environment here. Communicating and cooperating with different people other than the ZheJiang  students will definitely train myself to get to know more about different cultures.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Warm home</h2>

<p>Nevertheless, although countless difference between China and Singapore exists, I still felt pretty warm living in PGPR: We met lots of people speaking mandarin in consideration of us; We ate similar Chinese food in SuperSnack; We heard Prof Tay singing Chinese songs for us. There are so much more that remind me of China and it just felt like I am home. Therefore, I must express my gratitude to befrienders, mentors, staffs and Professors.</p>

<p>Overall, I believe I can get use to the life here very soon. Wish me a bright future in Singapore.</p>
