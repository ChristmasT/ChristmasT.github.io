Two articles from The Economist and Alex Renton discuss about the origins and effects of ocean acidification. Since factories produced massive carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, oceans will irrevocably absorb them with results including both positive and negative influence on the world as a whole.</p>

                  <h1>Adjusting to Singapore</h1>
                  <div class="a-content">
                      
                      <div class="a-content-text">
                        
                        	<p>A month! Without awareness of how time flies, I&#39;ve spent a month in this city. Countless fresh new things emerged before my eyes within this month and I&#39;ve strived hard to try to get used to them. Surprisingly, I can find similarity among most of unfamiliar features of Singapore: a sense of discipline.</p>

<p>Discipline doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be rules which must be strictly followed, but also united concepts or recognition planted in every citizen&#39;s mind. Queuing up consciously, lining up at the left hand side of escalators, banning drinking water on transportation means and be punctual are all representatives of obeying rules. It is because Singaporeans are willing to follow rules that they tend to be well-organized and efficient at dealing with tasks.</p>

<p>Being inspired by their rule consciousness, I gradually adopt some new methods for self scheduling. Except time for lectures and classes, SM2 scholars actually have plenty of time to arrange freely. Daily, weekly to monthly goals have been set. Thus simply following the plan is all I need to do, which is crucial to having sense of safety and clam coping upcoming events. After sticking to the plans for a few weeks, things I felt reluctant to do like working out become the default options for me. This is the magic of discipline.</p>

<p>Yet I cannot say I&#39;m fully adjusted to Singapore lifestyle. As a matter of fact, I never will in this dynamic country. From glimpse of the breathtaking image of multitudinous cargo ships when I was in Labrador Park and the splendid scenery seen from Marina Bay Sands, I can sense the pulsation of this vigorous country. Beneath those spectacular landscapes, numerous opportunities for progress await.</p>

<h4 id="toc_2">Studying with a positive attitude</h4>

<p>{Origin}: &quot;Enjoy&quot; life<br/>
{Significance}: Education can shape one in a either positive or negative way depends on pupils themselves.<br/>

<p>In these days studying is considered as a trouble by majority of young students, as they only want to enjoy their lives and consider study to be unimportant. Our younger generation has taken everything for granted and do not hold high value for education in their minds.<br/>
Whenever the time comes to study, a student’s mood sinks down and all the energy vanishes. This results in more time being consumed in learning that work due to lesser concentration. This issue needs to be addressed by parents and teachers in a productive manner, not simply forcing their children to more hours of studying or getting tuition after schools.<br/>
There should be some counseling in a way that explains to children that studying is one of the natural things to do in this world, as education makes a man, so can the lack of education break a man. They should be told that if studying is compulsory and necessary then why not do it with an enthusiasm similar to playing sports or performing some other activities and hobbies.</p>

<p>URL: <a href="http://www.positivecalm.com/positive-thinking-attitude/">http://www.positivecalm.com/positive-thinking-attitude/</a></p>

<p>{Origin}: lack of motivation of action</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The average person will not make any effort to do the change required in order to change their &#39;sad&#39; circumstances, and so they better complain and moan about all the unjust in the world and how they are the victims of everything that happens to them.</p>

We have 30,000-75,000 thoughts per day, most of them are nonproductive, worrying thoughts. If the thoughts don’t improve our state of mind, get rid of them.</li>
<li>Be mindful. Live in the moment. Pay attention and enjoy the experiences you have right this moment.</li>
<li>Always strive to be a good person, do the right thing. Be helpful.</li>
<li>Have a sense of humor. Laughter is a great stress reducer. Be playful, don’t take yourself too seriously.</li>
<li>Take care of your health: eat right, exercise.</li>
<li>Slow down. Take time to plan your actions. Stop making decisions on autopilot. Take all the decision that you make automatically and reevaluate your actions, there may be a better solution.</li>
<li>Connect with others.</li>
<li>Be thankful for the good things in your life.</li>

<h4 id="toc_6">Positive Attitude Is a State of Mind You Can Adopt</h4>

<p>URL: <a href="https://www.successconsciousness.com/positive_attitude_thinking.htm">https://www.successconsciousness.com/positive_attitude_thinking.htm</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>People with a positive frame of mind think about possibilities, growth, expansion and success. They expect happiness, health, love and good relationships. They think in terms of,<br/>
&#39;I can&#39;<br/>
&#39;I am able&#39;<br/>
&#39;I will succeed&#39;.<br/>
People with a positive attitude are not daunted by failures and obstacles. If things don&#39;t turn out well or as expected, they will try again. They approach what they do with a positive thinking frame of mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Read inspiring and motivating stories about people who achieved success. This will inspire and motivate you, as well as show you what they actually did, so you can implement it in your life.</li>
<li>Use affirmations. These positive statements will sink into your subconscious mind, which in turn will guide, motivate, and inspire you to tale action.</li>
<li>This also applies to visualization, the creation of mental scenes of what you want to achieve or have.</li>
<li>You don&#39;t have to allow negative thoughts to thrive in your mind. You can put an end to this habit. Be on guard to replace you negative thoughts with constructive ones. Start paying attention to your thoughts, and as negative thoughts start circulating in your mind, calmly, and without using force, replace them with constructive, happy and positive thoughts. You can make great changes in your life if you play the role of the doorkeeper of your mind.</li>
<li>Take action, don&#39;t be passive, in small matters and in big ones. If you keep busy doing things, there will be less likelihood of becoming negative, and a greater likelihood of being positive.</li>

<h2 id="toc_5">Review and thinking:</h2>

<p>China nowadays has increasingly significant status in the international network system. The most apparent reason is China is a country with 1.4 billion citizens. Therefore, even a tiny origin can stir a mass disturbance on the Internet which can be either positive or negative. Thus countless opportunities can be found in the phase when China is developing. However, instead of merely emphasize on how enormous Chinese Internet marketplace is. The speech stressed more on the facility the Internet can offer to those impecunious families with more alternatives. The Internet is offering billions of people with plentiful work positions as well as more advanced education within the speed of life. For those who came from metropolises, accessing to the Internet may be a rather easy task. Nevertheless, their ease may never be reachable for unprivileged individuals, speaking of which Chinese government&#39;s effort must be noticed. Their controversial policy of manipulating the overall internet environment definitely will have negative impacts on certain developments of the network. But on the other hand, the special policy also prevents Chinese companies being crushed by international network companies which can subsequently lead to better and more stable occupations offered to people, especially those from poor backgrounds. Moreover, since the Chinese government has so much power compared to another country, it can implement massive measures to optimize the Internet infrastructures. With the endeavor of government, there is a growing number of Chinese citizens who are connected to the Internet. Thus, generally speaking, I think a more positive future of Chinese Internet and its significant impacts on individuals can be sighted.</p>
