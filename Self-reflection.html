                  <h1>Experience interviewing undergraduates</h1>
                  <div class="a-content">
                      
                      <div class="a-content-text">
                        
                        	<p>Two weeks ago, we had interviewed NUS undergraduates for our Values project, which aims to find out the value NUS undergraduates hold. To reach the goal of 30 surveys efficiently, our team was split into two groups, and Song Qifeng and I was one group. </p>

<p>Since each person&#39;s task was to interview at least 6 undergraduates, Sonq Qifeng printed 20 surveys. Our first destination is a canteen in PGPR, Pines. However, we didn&#39;t get much result there since the queues were relatively short. Thus, people would not be willing to answer the question. As an alternative, going to FoS is our great choice because the queues there and the corresponding waiting time were longer. Thereby, we would have much longer time to interview an undergraduate. During the process of interviewing, we had discovered two interesting phenomena. First is that lots of customers were not undergraduates, even though they might look young. Second phenomenon is that among undergraduates, female undergraduates were generally more willing to answer the questions and the quality of the answers were generally better. Consequently, Song Qifeng and I had developed skills to spot those who are most likely to answer our questions. Nevertheless, to balance the sex ratio of our respondents, we still strived hard to seek male undergraduates to answer our question. Finally, after an hour, we&#39;ve successfully finished our mission, carrying 12 answer papers back to PGPR. </p>

<p>Through this experience of interview, I got how difficult it is to do an interview. The persons who conduct the survey should find the respondents who are willing to answer, have the time to answer and most importantly, happens to be the target group of the interview. Also, I&#39;ve done a revision thinking about how we could improve our interview. I came up with an idea that we should give those who answer our questions some rewards like chocolate so as to make them feel that it is beneficial to both respondents and interviewers instead of merely benefiting interviewers. In this way, our survey could be done much better and quicker.Â®</p>

<td>people often have opposing opinions considering its effects</td>

<p>This is the most common error I made over the past few weeks. Paraphrasing is one of the most important skills to express ideas, since nobody is willing to read an article fulfilled with the same words. However, it will be foolish to use incorrect words or collocations that do not even exist. Thus, to ensure I have used the correct words or expressions that can clearly convey my opinions, I will search particular words or phrases I want to use and check out some examples. In this way, correct words will be used instead of rigid translation from Chinese.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Sticking to the topic</h2>

<p><strong>Examples</strong>: Monday paragraph writing<br/>
Though it is technically not a grammar mistake, it is a worth-mentioning critical mistake I make sometimes. I am currently a college student who strive hard to write academic articles. Thus, using references instead of my own opinions becomes extremely crucial. Nonetheless, essays in China are composed based on one&#39;s own knowledge and analysis. Thereby, I sometimes will stray away from my initial topic, the result of which is severe. Right now, I try to use examples I find to support my idea instead of my own &quot;splendid theories&quot;</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Other grammar mistakes</h2>

<p>There are of course other mistakes I made in assignments like tense and punctuation. However, the frequency is not so high, especially compared to mistakes on wrong word choices. Still, while improving my ability to choose corrects words that fit in with the context., I will stay cautious about these mistakes.</p>

                  <h1>Adjusting to Singapore</h1>
                  <div class="a-content">
                      
                      <div class="a-content-text">
                        
                        	<p>A month! Without awareness of how time flies, I&#39;ve spent a month in this city. Countless fresh new things emerged before my eyes within this month and I&#39;ve strived hard to try to get used to them. Surprisingly, I can find similarity among most of unfamiliar features of Singapore: a sense of discipline.</p>

<p>Discipline doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be rules which must be strictly followed, but also united concepts or recognition planted in every citizen&#39;s mind. Queuing up consciously, lining up at the left hand side of escalators, banning drinking water on transportation means and be punctual are all representatives of obeying rules. It is because Singaporeans are willing to follow rules that they tend to be well-organized and efficient at dealing with tasks.</p>

<p>Being inspired by their rule consciousness, I gradually adopt some new methods for self scheduling. Except time for lectures and classes, SM2 scholars actually have plenty of time to arrange freely. Daily, weekly to monthly goals have been set. Thus simply following the plan is all I need to do, which is crucial to having sense of safety and clam coping upcoming events. After sticking to the plans for a few weeks, things I felt reluctant to do like working out become the default options for me. This is the magic of discipline.</p>

<p>Yet I cannot say I&#39;m fully adjusted to Singapore lifestyle. As a matter of fact, I never will in this dynamic country. From glimpse of the breathtaking image of multitudinous cargo ships when I was in Labrador Park and the splendid scenery seen from Marina Bay Sands, I can sense the pulsation of this vigorous country. Beneath those spectacular landscapes, numerous opportunities for progress await.</p>

                  <h1>My English goals and study plan for Phase 1</h1>
                  <div class="a-content">

                        	<p>Currently, I settle in a city pervaded with English and therefore not only daily communication,  but also academic writing requires me to be proficient in English. My weakness is I sometimes will shift away from the central topic and my word usage is occasionally inaccurate. Thus writing and reading are the main focus for me in phase one. Of course, additionally I will continue practicing my listening and speaking to better fit in the environment. Here are my goals for English studying.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Goals:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Capable of writing sophisticated academic essays. (better structures, word usage and sentence logic)</li>
<li>Read more English books or articles to get familiar with some common words, phrases and structures. (Including but not limited to TED, Economist and book reading)</li>
<li>Improve impromptu speech ability (watching speeches and seize every opportunity to present a speech)</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are some of the measures I will take to make me excel in English.<br/>
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-q0Kyr3VwKE0/W3jXTIzoJPI/AAAAAAAACXA/hXxE1CIM1ikGINKbHrH8ydKu5FmncH-TACHMYCw/I/Weekly%2BSchedule.png" alt="Weekly Schedule"/></p>

<ol>
<li>Through experience of mine, I found out that reading is the most efficient way to memorize words because I can naturally recall the sentence from which I can infer the meanings. Therefore I distribute some time for various English reading materials including Economist, tech articles (Macstories) and English books.</li>
<li>Mere reading is not enough for sure, I need writing to consolidate the words or expressions I recently learn. So I will take English writing assignments seriously. If I have vacant time, I will compose one or two technology reviews and post that on my blog.</li>
<li>In my opinion, listening and speaking are closely combined. Thus, I will watch some English videos to improve these abilities. As a matter of fact, my listening and speaking are dramatically improved via watching Youtube video without subtitles before I came to Singapore. Besides, I can learn certain speaking structures or words through watching English videos. </li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, plans above might have minor changes according to the assignment or activities. However, the general goal stays the same: improving my English capability.</p>
