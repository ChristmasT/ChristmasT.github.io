<h1>Experience interviewing undergraduates</h1>

<p>Two weeks ago, we had interviewed NUS undergraduates for our Values project, which aims to find out the value NUS undergraduates hold. To reach the goal of 30 surveys efficiently, our team was split into two groups, and Song Qifeng and I was one group. </p>

<p>Since each person&#39;s task was to interview at least 6 undergraduates, Sonq Qifeng printed 20 surveys. Our first destination is a canteen in PGPR, Pines. However, we didn&#39;t get much result there since the queues were relatively short. Thus, people would not be willing to answer the question. As an alternative, going to FoS is our great choice because the queues there and the corresponding waiting time were longer. Thereby, we would have much longer time to interview an undergraduate. During the process of interviewing, we had discovered two interesting phenomena. First is that lots of customers were not undergraduates, even though they might look young. Second phenomenon is that among undergraduates, female undergraduates were generally more willing to answer the questions and the quality of the answers were generally better. Consequently, Song Qifeng and I had developed skills to spot those who are most likely to answer our questions. Nevertheless, to balance the sex ratio of our respondents, we still strived hard to seek male undergraduates to answer our question. Finally, after an hour, we&#39;ve successfully finished our mission, carrying 12 answer papers back to PGPR. </p>

<p>Through this experience of interview, I got how difficult it is to do an interview. The persons who conduct the survey should find the respondents who are willing to answer, have the time to answer and most importantly, happens to be the target group of the interview. Also, I&#39;ve done a revision thinking about how we could improve our interview. I came up with an idea that we should give those who answer our questions some rewards like chocolate so as to make them feel that it is beneficial to both respondents and interviewers instead of merely benefiting interviewers. In this way, our survey could be done much better and quicker.Â®</p>
